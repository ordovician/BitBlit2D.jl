# Bit Blit 2D

Experiment with creating a game engine for 2D pixel art style of games. Initially I will just use this as a playground to try out the SDL2 library to draw graphics. 

To test the program, make sure this package is in your path, and enter the Julia REPL:

    julia> using BitBlit2D
    julia> main()
    
This will currently show a window temporarily and draw a line across.
